# 🔐 Password Strength Analyzer

A simple yet effective **Python command-line tool** that evaluates password strength and provides feedback for creating more secure passwords.  
This project applies key cybersecurity concepts learned through the *Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate*, including password entropy, hashing, and risk mitigation.

---

## 🧠 Overview

The **Password Strength Analyzer** checks for:
- Password length and character diversity  
- Use of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special symbols  
- Detection of weak or common patterns (e.g., "password", "123", "qwerty")  
- Secure password hashing using the **SHA-256** algorithm
- Skills: Python, Regex, SHA-256 Hashing, Secure Coding, Risk Assessment, Git, Cybersecurity Fundamentals

## ⚙️ Features

- 🧩 Easy-to-use command-line interface  
- 💡 Strength scoring system (Weak / Medium / Strong)  
- 🔒 SHA-256 hashing for secure password representation  
- 🗒️ Personalized feedback for password improvement

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher  
- No external dependencies  

### Run the Script
```bash
python3 password_analyzer.py
```

## Exmaple Output
```
- Enter your password: *********
- Password Strength: Medium (65/100)
- Feedback:
- Add more special characters.
- Increase length beyond 12 characters.
- SHA-256 Hash: 9f86d081884c7d659a2feaa0c55ad015a3bf4f1b2b0b822cd15d6c15b0f00a08
