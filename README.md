# 🔐 Password Strength Analyzer

A simple yet effective **Python command-line tool** that evaluates password strength and provides feedback for creating more secure passwords.  
This project applies key cybersecurity concepts learned through the *Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate*, including password entropy, hashing, and risk mitigation.

## 🧠 Overview

The **Password Strength Analyzer** checks for:
- Password length and character diversity  
- Use of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special symbols  
- Detection of weak or common patterns (e.g., "password", "123", "qwerty")  
- Secure password hashing using the **SHA-256** algorithm
